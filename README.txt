This is a small portfolio project for the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer course. 

The objective is to create a generator of nonsensical random jokes using JavaScript!

The jokes will almost never going to make sense. This program takes normal pre-written (boring) jokes, scramble them and return funnier nonsensical new ones!

Have Fun!
